      <h2>What Physical AI Means</h2>
      <p>Physical AI is the discipline of applying machine intelligence directly to real-world environments. Unlike digital AI, which processes structured data from screens and databases, Physical AI interprets the unstructured, dynamic reality of physical spaces — stores, airports, museums, offices, and public venues.</p>
      <p>At its core, Physical AI answers a fundamental question: <em>What is actually happening in this space, right now?</em> It converts raw spatial data — 3D point clouds, movement trajectories, proximity patterns — into structured, actionable intelligence.</p>
      <p>This intelligence enables operators to understand visitor flow, measure engagement, identify bottlenecks, and optimize layouts with the same rigor that digital businesses apply to website analytics.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Physical AI vs. Digital-Only AI</h2>
      <p>Digital AI has transformed how organizations understand online behavior. Every click, scroll, and transaction is captured and analyzed. But the physical world — where 90% of commerce and human activity still occurs — has remained largely unmeasured.</p>
      <p>The gap is structural. Digital environments are inherently data-rich: every interaction generates a log. Physical environments are data-poor by default. Without purpose-built sensing infrastructure, there is no equivalent of a "page view" for a physical aisle, no "session duration" for a retail zone.</p>
      <p>Physical AI closes this gap. By deploying 3D sensors that capture spatial geometry in real time, it creates a continuous, privacy-compliant data layer over any physical environment. The result is a digital representation of physical reality — a foundation for analysis, simulation, and optimization.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Sensors vs. Intelligence</h2>
      <p>Hardware alone does not constitute Physical AI. A LiDAR sensor mounted on a ceiling generates millions of data points per second — but without an intelligence layer, this data is noise.</p>
      <p>The value chain of Physical AI consists of three layers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sensing</strong> — capturing 3D spatial data from the environment using LiDAR, depth sensors, or similar technologies</li>
        <li><strong>Perception</strong> — converting raw point clouds into structured objects: people, carts, groups, queues, and their trajectories over time</li>
        <li><strong>Intelligence</strong> — deriving actionable insights: zone occupancy, dwell time, flow patterns, behavioral clustering, and attribution</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A mature <a href="./spatial-intelligence.html">spatial intelligence platform</a> operates across all three layers, abstracting the complexity of hardware into a unified analytics experience. The sensor becomes a commodity; the intelligence becomes the product.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Why Physical AI Must Be Privacy-First</h2>
      <p>Physical AI systems observe real people in real spaces. This creates an obligation that digital analytics rarely faces: the system must be architecturally incapable of identifying individuals.</p>
      <p>Camera-based approaches fail this test by design. Even with post-processing anonymization, the raw data contains faces, clothing, and biometric features. A privacy breach is always one misconfiguration away.</p>
      <p>LiDAR-based Physical AI takes a fundamentally different approach. The sensor captures only anonymous 3D geometry — clusters of points moving through space. There are no images, no faces, no personally identifiable information at any stage of the data pipeline. Privacy is not a feature; it is an architectural constraint.</p>
      <p>This distinction is critical for GDPR compliance, for public trust, and for enterprise deployment at scale. Organizations deploying Physical AI in sensitive environments — healthcare, education, public transit — require this level of assurance.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Why Deployment Models Matter</h2>
      <p>Enterprise adoption of Physical AI depends not only on technical capability but on commercial structure. Two models have emerged:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>CAPEX (Hybrid)</strong> — organizations purchase sensing hardware upfront and pay a monthly fee for the intelligence platform. This model suits organizations with capital budgets and long-term infrastructure plans.</li>
        <li><strong>OPEX (Full Service)</strong> — the entire solution is delivered as a monthly service, including hardware. This model eliminates upfront investment, simplifies procurement, and aligns cost with value delivery.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Both models can deliver identical analytical capability. The choice is a matter of financial preference and organizational structure, not technical limitation. A well-designed Physical AI platform supports both, ensuring that deployment economics never become a barrier to adoption.</p>
