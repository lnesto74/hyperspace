The customer pays a predictable monthly amount that covers sensors, installation, analytics platform access, maintenance, and support. Hardware refresh and replacement are included."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is LiDAR as a Service more expensive than buying hardware?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Over a standard contract term, the total cost of ownership is financially equivalent. The difference is cash flow: OPEX avoids large upfront payments, simplifies procurement, and shifts risk from the customer to the provider. Many enterprises prefer this model for technology that supports ongoing operational optimization."}}]}</script>

<h1>LiDAR as a Service: <span class="gradient-text">Capex-Free</span> Spatial Analytics</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Deploy enterprise-grade spatial intelligence with zero upfront investment. Hardware, software, and support — all included in a single monthly fee.</p></section>
<article class="container">
<section class="content-section"><h2>The Capex Barrier to Physical AI</h2>
<p>For many organizations, the decision to deploy <a href="./physical-ai.html">Physical AI</a> is not a question of value — it is a question of procurement. Traditional deployment models require capital expenditure approval for hardware purchase, creating delays, budget competition, and organizational friction.</p>
<p>The irony is structural: the technology that could optimize millions in operational spend is blocked by a five-figure hardware purchase order. Innovation teams see the ROI. Finance teams see the capex line. The project stalls.</p>
<p>LiDAR as a Service eliminates this barrier entirely. The entire solution — sensors, edge computing, <a href="./spatial-intelligence.html">spatial intelligence platform</a>, installation, maintenance, and support — is delivered as a monthly operational expense. No capital approval. No hardware ownership. No procurement friction.</p></section>
<section class="content-section"><h2>How the OPEX Model Works</h2>
<p>In a full OPEX deployment, the service provider retains ownership of the physical infrastructure. The customer subscribes to a spatial intelligence service, paying a predictable monthly fee that includes:</p>
<ul><li><strong>LiDAR sensors</strong> — ceiling-mounted, configured and calibrated for the venue</li>
<li><strong>Edge computing</strong> — on-site processing hardware for real-time analytics</li>
<li><strong>Platform access</strong> — full <a href="./spatial-intelligence.html">spatial intelligence analytics</a>, dashboards, APIs, and reporting</li>
<li><strong>Installation and commissioning</strong> — professional deployment and sensor calibration</li>
<li><strong>Ongoing support</strong> — monitoring, maintenance, firmware updates, and hardware replacement</li></ul>
<p>The monthly fee is calculated based on venue size and sensor count. Use the <a href="./#configurator">configurator</a> to get an instant estimate for your specific space.</p></section>
<section class="content-section"><h2>OPEX vs. Hybrid: Comparing Deployment Models</h2>
<p>Organizations that prefer to own hardware can choose the Hybrid model: purchase sensors upfront at a lower total cost, with a reduced monthly fee for the software platform. Both models deliver identical analytical capability.</p>
<div class="cards-grid">
<div class="card"><h3>Full OPEX (LiDAR as a Service)</h3><p>Zero upfront cost. Single monthly fee covers everything. Ideal for organizations that prefer operational expenditure, want to avoid procurement complexity, or are piloting before committing to infrastructure purchase.</p></div>
<div class="card"><h3>Hybrid (Hardware + SaaS)</h3><p>Purchase sensors upfront. Lower monthly software fee. Ideal for organizations with available capital budgets, long-term infrastructure plans, or preference for asset ownership.</p></div></div>
<p>Critically, both models are financially equivalent over the contract term. The total cost of ownership is the same — only the cash flow profile differs. This ensures that deployment economics never become a barrier to adopting <a href="./physical-ai.html">Physical AI</a>.</p></section>
<section class="content-section"><h2>Why Capex-Free Matters for Enterprise</h2>
<ul><li><strong>Faster procurement</strong> — OPEX budgets are typically approved faster and with less organizational friction than capital expenditure</li>
<li><strong>Risk transfer</strong> — hardware ownership, maintenance, and obsolescence risk sit with the provider, not the customer</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong> — add venues to the service without additional capital approval cycles</li>
<li><strong>Pilot-friendly</strong> — test the platform in one location before committing to a portfolio-wide rollout, with minimal financial exposure</li>
<li><strong>Budget predictability</strong> — fixed monthly costs simplify financial planning and eliminate surprise maintenance expenses</li></ul></section>
<section class="content-section"><h2>Hardware-Agnostic Advantage</h2>
<p>LiDAR as a Service is only possible when the <a href="./lidar-analytics.html">analytics platform</a> is <a href="./hardware-agnostic-lidar.html">hardware-agnostic</a>. If the platform is locked to a single sensor vendor, the service provider cannot optimize hardware costs, cannot upgrade sensors without platform changes, and cannot negotiate competitive procurement terms.</p>
<p>A truly agnostic platform decouples the intelligence layer from the sensing layer, enabling the service provider to select the optimal sensor for each venue type and to upgrade hardware transparently as the LiDAR market evolves.</p></section>
