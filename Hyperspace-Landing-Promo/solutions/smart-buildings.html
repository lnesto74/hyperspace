<h1>Smart Building Analytics for <span class="gradient-text">Space Utilization</span></h1>
<p class="subtitle">Understand how people use physical spaces — offices, lobbies, common areas, and meeting rooms — to optimize real estate, improve workplace design, and reduce operational costs.</p></section>
<article class="container">
<section class="content-section"><h2>The Space Utilization Challenge</h2>
<p>Commercial real estate is typically the second-largest expense for organizations after payroll. Yet most buildings operate with minimal understanding of how their space is actually used. Meeting rooms sit empty despite being "booked." Entire floors are underutilized while teams compete for desks. Common areas designed for collaboration remain unused.</p>
<p>The shift to hybrid work has intensified this challenge. Occupancy patterns are no longer predictable. Fixed allocations waste resources. Organizations need continuous, accurate measurement of how space is used — not scheduled, but actual — to make informed decisions about their real estate portfolio.</p>
<p><a href="../physical-ai.html">Physical AI</a> provides this measurement through anonymous 3D sensing that captures occupancy and movement patterns without identifying or tracking individuals.</p></section>
<section class="content-section"><h2>Why Traditional Tools Fall Short</h2>
<ul><li><strong>Badge swipe data</strong> — records building entry but nothing about where people go or how long they stay in specific areas</li>
<li><strong>Desk booking systems</strong> — measure intent, not actual usage. No-shows and early departures create significant data gaps</li>
<li><strong>PIR motion sensors</strong> — detect presence/absence but cannot count people, measure dwell time, or track movement patterns</li>
<li><strong>Camera systems</strong> — raise significant employee privacy concerns and are often rejected by works councils and labor regulations</li>
<li><strong>Periodic surveys</strong> — capture self-reported preferences, not actual behavior. Subject to recency bias and low response rates</li></ul></section>
<section class="content-section"><h2>How Spatial Intelligence Addresses Buildings</h2>
<ul><li><strong>Real-time occupancy</strong> — accurate people counts for every zone, floor, and building, updated continuously</li>
<li><strong>Utilization analytics</strong> — percentage of capacity used over time for meeting rooms, open plan areas, and common spaces</li>
<li><strong>Movement flow</strong> — understand how people circulate between zones, identifying natural collaboration hubs and underused areas</li>
<li><strong>Peak and pattern analysis</strong> — identify occupancy peaks by day of week, time of day, and season to inform scheduling and facilities management</li>
<li><strong>Space design validation</strong> — measure whether redesigned spaces achieve their intended usage patterns</li>
<li><strong>Energy and HVAC optimization</strong> — feed real-time occupancy data into building management systems to reduce energy waste in unoccupied zones</li></ul></section>
<section class="content-section"><h2>Key Performance Indicators</h2>
<div class="cards-grid">
<div class="card"><h3>Space Utilization Rate</h3><p>Actual occupancy vs. capacity across all zones — the foundation for portfolio optimization decisions.</p></div>
<div class="card"><h3>Peak Occupancy</h3><p>Maximum simultaneous occupancy by zone, floor, and building — informing capacity planning and safety compliance.</p></div>
<div class="card"><h3>Meeting Room Efficiency</h3><p>Actual usage vs. bookings, average meeting size vs. room capacity, and no-show rates.</p></div>
<div class="card"><h3>Collaboration Patterns</h3><p>Flow between departments and common areas, identifying organic interaction points and isolation risks.</p></div></div></section>
<section class="content-section"><h2>Deployment Considerations</h2>
<p><a href="../lidar-analytics.html">LiDAR sensors</a> integrate seamlessly into commercial building environments. Ceiling-mounted units are unobtrusive and require only power and network connectivity. A typical office floor of 1,000 sqm requires 2-4 sensors for complete coverage.</p>
<p>Employee privacy is addressed architecturally: LiDAR captures only anonymous 3D geometry. No images, no identification, no tracking of individuals. This approach consistently passes works council reviews and privacy impact assessments, enabling deployment in jurisdictions with strict employee monitoring regulations.</p>
<p><a href="../spatial-intelligence.html">Spatial intelligence</a> data integrates with building management systems (BMS), workplace experience platforms, and corporate real estate dashboards through standard APIs.</p></section>
