      <h2>What Spatial Intelligence Is</h2>
      <p>Spatial intelligence is the ability to extract meaningful, structured knowledge from the physical geometry of a space and the behavior of the people within it. It sits at the intersection of 3D sensing, real-time data processing, and behavioral analytics.</p>
      <p>In practice, spatial intelligence answers questions that were previously unanswerable at scale: How many people entered zone B in the last hour? What is the average dwell time near the endcap display? Which path do visitors take most frequently? How does a layout change affect flow distribution?</p>
      <p>These questions are not new. What is new is the ability to answer them continuously, accurately, and without compromising individual privacy — using the data infrastructure of <a href="./physical-ai.html">Physical AI</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Why 3D Space Matters</h2>
      <p>Two-dimensional data — door counters, beam sensors, overhead cameras — provides a partial view of spatial activity. It can count entries but not distinguish between a person who spent 30 seconds and one who spent 15 minutes.</p>
      <p>Three-dimensional spatial data changes the equation fundamentally. A 3D point cloud captures the volumetric reality of a space: the position, height, and movement vector of every occupant, updated multiple times per second. This enables:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Accurate trajectory reconstruction</strong> — full paths from entry to exit</li>
        <li><strong>Height-based classification</strong> — distinguishing adults from children, people from carts</li>
        <li><strong>Precise zone analytics</strong> — measuring dwell time within arbitrarily defined regions</li>
        <li><strong>Behavioral segmentation</strong> — grouping visitors by movement patterns, not demographics</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Understanding Flow, Dwell, and Behavior</h2>
      <h3>Flow</h3>
      <p>Flow describes how people move through a space over time. It encompasses entry/exit patterns, path preferences, corridor utilization, and bottleneck formation. Flow analytics reveal the structural dynamics of a venue.</p>
      <h3>Dwell</h3>
      <p>Dwell measures how long people remain in a defined zone. It is the physical equivalent of "time on page" in digital analytics. High dwell in a retail zone may indicate engagement; high dwell at a checkout may indicate a queue problem.</p>
      <h3>Behavior</h3>
      <p>Behavior is the synthesis of flow and dwell into patterns. Behavioral clustering groups visitors by how they move — browsers, mission shoppers, explorers — without any personal identification. These clusters enable operators to understand their audience at a structural level.</p>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>From Spatial Insight to Action</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Real-time dashboards</strong> — live occupancy, zone heatmaps, and alert thresholds</li>
        <li><strong>Historical analysis</strong> — trend comparison, day-over-day performance tracking</li>
        <li><strong>A/B measurement</strong> — quantifying the impact of layout changes on visitor behavior</li>
        <li><strong>Integration</strong> — feeding spatial data into existing BI tools and operational workflows</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The goal is not to generate more data. It is to make physical spaces as measurable and optimizable as digital properties.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>The Role of Simulation and Replay</h2>
      <p>One of the most powerful capabilities of spatial intelligence is the ability to replay historical data in a 3D environment. Rather than relying on summary statistics, operators can watch how visitors moved through their space at any point in time — compressed, filtered, and annotated.</p>
      <p>Replay enables forensic analysis: understanding why a bottleneck formed, how visitors responded to a new display, or whether a queue management change improved throughput. Combined with behavioral clustering, replay becomes a tool for hypothesis testing — the spatial equivalent of A/B testing in the physical world.</p>
